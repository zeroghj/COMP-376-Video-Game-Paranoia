Her hand, its still moving!
She was still alive. I have to get up, I have to get back to her. Return by her side and save her!
I must find a way to escape this hellhole, no matter what it takes! She's waiting for me, I know she is, that's why Ive made it so far.
For her! For my beloved, I must do everything I can, return home, and free from this nightmare!.
