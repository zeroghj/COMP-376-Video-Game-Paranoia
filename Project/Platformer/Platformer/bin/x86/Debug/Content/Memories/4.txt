It's her again, she really comes up a lot in these memories. Where is this now? Looks like some kind of cottage.
Why are we here? Are we still running from the angry mob? What happened last time?
Oh no, she's crying. What's going on, why is she crying, is it my fault?
Looks like she's fine now, wonder what it was I said to her then...
