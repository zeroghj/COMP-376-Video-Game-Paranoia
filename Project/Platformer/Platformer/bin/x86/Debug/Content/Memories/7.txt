These memories... this, these are all memories of her. 
That day at the gallery, the date on the following evening. All those nights, those months, those years... they're finally coming back to me.
Her luscious hair, her beautiful eyes... how could I have forgotten her... How could I have forgotten the face of my own wife!
This locket, it was a gift from my wife... I can't believe it. It was her all along. It's thanks to her and this locket that I was able to survive till now.
No wonder I felt safe when I held onto this, it's because it reminds me of her, of home.
