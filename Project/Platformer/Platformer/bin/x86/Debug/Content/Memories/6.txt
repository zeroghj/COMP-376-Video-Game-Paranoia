This... this fire! This is where we left off last time.
Damn it, the fire is spreading!  It's everywhere already! Why havent you guys left yet, what in gods name are you still doing inside!
Why, her leg is trapped! Get it off her, hurry up, theres no time to lose!
Everything is turning pitch black. What happened, is she still ok?
