My wife… she died in that fire! She died because of me! It was all my fault! This is my punishment, isn't it?! This is my purgatory! Sent to spend an eternity in this hell-like maze.
“You're wrong!”
Then why?! Why am I here if not to repent for my crime! Leave? I should just stay here and rot. There's nothing left for me.
“Please, listen to me! You saw the fire, you saw her in there, but you still don't know what happens after that”
SHE DIES. THAT'S IT, END OF STORY.
“No, it doesn’t end there. And you know it. Don't give up hope, not yet, please. ”
Why? There's no point!
“Find the remaining memories, for you will regret it if you don't”
Regret! I regret it already, I regret finding out again, I regret remembering what I've done!
“STOP BEING SUCH A SPINELESS COWARD. Finish what you started and get to the bottom of everything.”
“I know you are suffering, but if you give up now, you'll never move on. Find the final piece of the puzzle. Hope remains”
