What are those?
"Those are fragments of Dimensional planes invading this world. You have the power to interact with those blocks and use them as footholds."
And how would I do that?
"Hold onto your locket, and press any of the four buttons 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K' and you will bring forth the power to bring those blocks to life."
"Press 'G' and it will activate the Blue and the Green blocks"
"Press 'H' and it will activate the Green and Red blocks"
"Press 'J' and it will activate the Blue and Purple blocks"
"Press 'K' and it will activate the Purple and Red blocks"
"Use this knowledge to solve the mystery of this world, open the path towards your escape from this maze"
