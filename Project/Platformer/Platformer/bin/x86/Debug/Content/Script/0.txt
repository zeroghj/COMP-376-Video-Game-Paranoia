"Please, don't be afraid, I'm not here to hurt you."
"I know it's difficult to trust me, but I assure you, I'm here to help."
"First, calm yourself down a bit, and I'll try to explain as much as I can."
Who... who are you? What's going on here? Where am I? Why am I here, WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER ANYTHING?!
"We don't have much time. First, please look inside your pocket, you'll find something that will help you remember."
A... A locket? *what is this, it feels familiar... almost like home...*
"Have you calmed down a bit yet?"
Yes, I... I don't know why, but I feel at ease when I hold on to it. What is this... to me? Who am I?
"You'll find out in time, I apologize, but I am unable to answer all your questions"
"For now, follow me, it's a bit dangerous, but I'll help you find the answers you seek, and the way out of here"
Here? Where's here? Where are we, please! Tell me!
*The ghastly figure disappears without waiting for a reply* Go right and follow her to the next location.
