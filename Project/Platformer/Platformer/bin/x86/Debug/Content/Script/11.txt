I saw her hand... your hand reach out to me. She's still there. She's still alive isn't she?
“I’m sure that's something you can confirm for yourself once you see her in person”
So, I can see her again, once I leave? 
“Without a doubt”
And what about you?
“I'll be fine”
You never told me who you were.
*She giggles*
“I'm sure you already know the answer to that”
Will I see you again?
“If that is what you wish, but you'll have to wake up first”
