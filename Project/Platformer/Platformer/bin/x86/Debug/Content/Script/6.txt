So I was an artist of some sort... this crazy world is starting to make sense, these freakish landscape... these are my paintings aren't they?
“Yes, they are. This world is a reflection of a part of you.”
I still don't quite understand? Why, are you saying I made this place? That I created this ridiculous hellhole? I'm an artist, not some kind of god!
“I'm sure you’ve already realized, that something is wrong with this world, and your abilities. You should start to understand now.”
“I think you’ve begun to understand how you’re managing to change dimensions, even if you chose not deny it”
