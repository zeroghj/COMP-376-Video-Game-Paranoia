So when are you going to tell me anything? Are you just going to lead me around in this maze?
"I am unable to explain to you the things you seek, but I can help you find the answers... if you can trust me"
There's so much I want to complain about but, I'm a little short on choices at the moment. Can you tell me why you're helping me at least?
*muffled sounds, like a distorted whisper*
Can't you tell me more than that? No? I can't say that I trust you yet, but it's better than wandering around alone at this point. So what am I supposed to do now?
"You must find the exits to each labyrinth and leave this dungeon"
You make it sound like a piece of cake? And how do I go and do that?
"Throughout the labyrinth are scattered "keys" that will help you leave this place. Finding them all may not be an easy task, but it is IMPERATIVE you find them all else you may never leave"
So I just have to run all over the place looking for these "keys" and I'll be able to get out? Then will you tell me who I am, where this "place" is, and what I'm doing here?
"Those keys will do more than open the path towards the exit, they will aid you in remembering that which you must"
Wait! What the heck does that mean? Are these keys somehow related to my memories? HEY! WAIT! ANSWER ME!
*The ghost vanishes*
