These visions?! More memories? What are these? Paintings, art, drawings, scribbles? I don't understand!
All this crowd, just to see some paintings? 
So Daniel the world reknown artist? Who would have known? 
So why do these paintings look like this crazy world, what's the whole deal with that? This still doesn't make things easier to understand
