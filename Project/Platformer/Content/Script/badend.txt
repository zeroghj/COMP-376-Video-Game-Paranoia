"The doctors say there's no hope. They say that you'll never wake up... I don't want to believe it, so please, wake up. Wake up..."
*sob* *sob* "I can't live without you! It's too hard, I don't want to be alone again! I never want to go back to that house all by myself"
"Remember, on the day we got married, we promised to be together forever." *sob* "I'll stay by your side no matter what, you know that."
"But the doctors... the doctors, they don't think you have much time left..."
"They're wrong, they have to be, because I know, one day, you'll come back, you'll wake up and we'll be together again."
"You'll hold me in your arms, and whisper to me softly that you love me, like you've always done." *sob* *sob*
"So, so that's why... I-I-I believe you'll wake up and come back to me and everything will work out just fine.." *sob*
*beep*
*beep*
*beeep*
"I never want to be alone again, please don't leave me.." *whimper*
*beeeeeeeep*
*beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee--
*The ECG flatlines, you were unable to find all your memories, and have died*
*Your wife cries desperately at your bedside, no longer able to contain her grief*
BAD END
