Wait! Wait up! Whoaaa that looks dangerous... you're not expecting me to jump across this are you?
"This labyrinth is filled with danger, but you are not powerless in this world. Hold out your locket, and press Q "
Whoa! Did I do that? What just happened there?
"This entire labyrinth is fragmented, fractions of this world lay superimposed over each other, and whenever you hold onto your locket you gain access to these parallel worlds"
Parallel worlds? Fractions? Now I'm even more confused! What's going on here? WHat exactly is this locket? How am I doing all this?
"You will find your answers as you progress. WHen you find yourself cornered, and know not where to go, remember, this world has far more than the eye can see"
Wait! What kind of answer is that? That explains NOTHING!!!! COME BACK! 
GODDAMNIT! WHat the heck is going on?! Not only can't I still remember a thing, but now I'm going crazy as well? Dimensions? Worlds, this is too much!
*Continue along the newly formed platform, the truth awaits, as well as more danger!*
