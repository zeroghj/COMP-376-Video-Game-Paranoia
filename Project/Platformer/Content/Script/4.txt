You... you, why didn't you tell me anything, why couldn't you even tell me my name, I'm sure you knew! What else are you hiding from me!?
I'm tired of your games! Tell me why I'm here! I can't take this anymore, why do I have to go look for my memories, why were they scattered in the first place?
“The answer to those questions and more, you will find them one by one as you regain your memories.”
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME???
“Because, unfortunately, I don't know more than you do, I can only guide you to your next memories” 
“We don't have much time left, we must hurry”
Why? What happens when time runs out? 
“When your time is up, you will die, you will never wake from this nightmare, and you will be trapped here for eternity, so please”
“Please, I beg of you”
“Come back to me”
“Wha- what was that? What did you say?” *the ghost disappears yet again*
