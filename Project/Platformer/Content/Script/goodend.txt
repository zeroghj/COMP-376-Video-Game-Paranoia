"Wake up... please... wake up..."
"The doctors are saying you'll never wake up... but I believe you will. I KNOW you will. "
"I know that one day, you'll come back to me, that you'll wake up, and you'll hold me tightly in your arms. "
"So I'll wait. I'll wait for you, every day, every night until you wake up and I hear you say my name."
"I'll stay at this bedside, and hold your hand. I don't know if you can hear me, but maybe, just maybe, I can reach you."
"I don't care if the doctors say it's hopeless but I will stay by your side, and maybe my voice will guide you, and bring you back to me. "
"So please... please wake up, and come back to me." *sob* *sob*

Linda...
"I can hear you. Daniel, I'm right here, right beside you, can you hear me! Please Listen to my voice, and wake up!"
"Doctor! Doctor! I think my Husband is waking up! Please hurry!"
*Your eyes open slowly, you see your crying wife, she grabs your hands. You feel the warm conforting feeling you've felt everytime you held the locket*
Linda... I'm back. 
*She smiles back at you, choking back her tears and sobs, she whispers softly*
"Welcome back."
*she collapses on top of you, breaking into loud cries, relieved. You hold her as tight as you can, tears streaming down your face*
